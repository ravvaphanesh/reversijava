# othello
A java implementation of reversi / othello for two players. There are two programs: ui and uiautomated. ui can be used to play person to person. While uiautomated can be used to see two computers play. Have fun watching those beasts fighting :p .

### ui.java is the main file
### uiautomated.java is the automated file
open bash and run
## javac ui.java
## java ui
or 
## javac uiautomated.java 
## javac uiautomated
and play
